## Introduction

As more and more people are getting into technology, it has certainly increased the dependency on the digital equipments such as Mobile phones, Tablets, laptops etc.. Now a days, people even do socializing over the internet. Online tutorials are made to help students learn from their home. Another major benefit of this digitization is that people tend to shop online and therefore today there are large number of E-commerce companies such as amazon.com who have established their businesses online. People like to order their products online and get it delivered at their door steps which saves their time and effort. Due to such a high demand, these online e-commerce companies make attractive websites and mobile applications to help the users to browse through their products and order them online conveniently. Therefore we have developed a web application to understand the functioning of the e-commerce application as an IT administrator.

## Description of the functionality:

We have developed a online web application for a health company as a demo to show the working of the online e-commerce application. Our web application is built by leveraging various existing technologies which as described in this section as below:

### 1.  Springboot-starter-web

We used springboot for our project as it provides fast development of application which can be simple or web-based. It is comparitively easier and takes less time in configuring and building the applications. The springboot leverages the Spring framework. It provides the software developers the functionalities of spring framework and web servers combined in one single module. Springboot also provides several other useful features such as effective database transactions, integration with Java APIs and simultaneously reduces the time of development.

### 2. H2 Database engine

H2 database engine is an open source, fast, reliable JDBC API. It has builtin servers and database modes such as in-memory database. The H2 database engine also provides browser based application for the console for easy access and also removes any binding or mapping complexities that occurs while using other databases. Also, the main feature is that it is comparitively very lightweight.

### 3. Javascript/CSS/HTML

In our application we used three languages for our web pages. All the languages mentioned have their own functionality and work side by side to enhace the working of our online health application.
We used HTML to put the contents in our web-pages such as login,registration forms and product details.
In order to effectively display the contents specified in the HTML, we used CSS.
At the end, to attach the functionalities to these web pages, we used Java script. The Javascript manages all the functioning of the web-pages such as generating cart, adding products to cart, updating stock etc.

### 4. Maven

For effective project management we used maven. It helps in building the Java project by loading the libraries, packages from the repositories and thereby providing the existing functionalities into our java project. It makes the process of building projects easy and helps in maintaining the uniformity across the build system.

## Use Cases of Health Application

The main purpose of making a online health application is to understand the detailed functionality behind an online e-commerce website which we use in our daily life. The demo web application we developed has certain functionality which resembles with an existing e-commerce web application.

1. The health application can be used by a medical story or a pharmacy to put their business online.
2. They can sell products to customers who are looking to buy health products online.
3. This online service by the pharmacy will help the patients who are seriously ill and cannot go out to buy medicines.
4. The online selling of products will certainly ensure security on the bills as it can avoid any kind of theft or scam from the workers.
5. It will also help the administrator of the pharmacy to easily update the stocks on the portal using the special "admin" rights which makes it secure.
6. In this portal, any number of the customers can register their accounts simulataneously using the registration page.
7. This web application provide the flexibility to the customers to use either of payment methods such as cash on delivery(COD), net-banking or even by credit/debit cards.
8. Another important use case is that it allows guest login and therefore all the customers do not need to login
